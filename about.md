I am interested on using open source software tools for spatial data visualization and analysis.

### More Information

My current research interests at Universidad Distrital are mainly related to estimation of vegetation attributes using imaging and non-imaging data collected from remote and proximal sensors. I have recently started to test the potential of multispectral images acquired from Unmmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in vegetation applications.
